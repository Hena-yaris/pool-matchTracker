## ‚ú® Key Features

RackUp is built to handle the entire lifecycle of a pool match, from setup to history logging.

### 1. üéØ Live Match Tracking
* **Player Setup:** Quickly enter and manage all players before the game starts.
* **Live High Scores:** See real-time totals and leaderboard positions updated immediately after every score entry.
* **In-Game Stats:** Visual cards display the current **Leader** and the **Lowest** scoring player at all times.

### 2. üèÜ Automated Tiebreaker Resolution
* **Intelligent Routing:** If multiple players share the **highest** or **lowest** score upon finishing, the app automatically routes to a dedicated tiebreaker screen.
* **Clear Results:** After tiebreakers, the final results are displayed in **descending order** (highest score first) for a clear winner announcement.

### 3. üíæ Data Persistence & History
* **Automatic Saving (PWA):** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with **`localStorage`** persistence. You can refresh the page, close the app, or lose connection, and your current match data will be instantly recovered.
* **Game History:** All completed matches, including final scores, dates, and the winner, are permanently logged.
* **Clear History:** Easily view and **permanently delete** all past game history with a dedicated "Clear History" button.
